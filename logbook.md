- Made a very simple html that shows a box on top of a hiro marker
- Use a VSCode extension 'Live Server' to display the result
- Create a self-signed SSL certificate (following [this website](https://www.akadia.com/services/ssh_test_certificate.html)) so that I can access the live server from mobile devices which required a secure connection
- Add the box programmatically rather than within the html
